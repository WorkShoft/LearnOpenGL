# Light
* 3 components: ambient, diffuse and specular lighting
	* Ambient lighting: constant that always gives the object some color.
	* Diffuse lighting: directional impact a light object has on an object.
	* Specular lighting: the bright spot of a light that appears on shiny objects (often more inclined to the color of the light than the color of the object).

* Simulate real-world materials by ambient, diffuse, specular and shininess [table](http://devernay.free.fr/cours/opengl/materials.html)
